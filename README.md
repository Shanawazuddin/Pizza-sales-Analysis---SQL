# Pizza Sales Analysis - SQL

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of a **Pizza Sales Dataset** using **SQL**. The dataset contains information about pizza orders, customer preferences, pricing, and sales data. I addressed various questions to extract valuable insights that can drive better decision-making for businesses in the food industry.

### Key Questions Solved:

#### **Basic Analysis**:
- **Total Orders**: Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
- **Total Revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
- **Highest Priced Pizza**: Identify the highest-priced pizza.
- **Most Common Pizza Size**: Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
- **Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types**: List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

#### **Intermediate Analysis**:
- **Pizza Quantity by Category**: Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
- **Order Distribution by Hour**: Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
- **Category-wise Pizza Distribution**: Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
- **Average Pizzas Ordered per Day**: Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
- **Top 3 Pizza Types by Revenue**: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

#### **Advanced Analysis**:
- **Percentage Contribution by Pizza Type**: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
- **Cumulative Revenue Over Time**: Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
- **Top 3 Pizza Types by Category**: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

### Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: For querying and data analysis.
- **Database**: MySQL.
- **Tools**: SQL Workbench.

### How to Run the Project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the **Pizza Sales Dataset** into your SQL database.
3. Open the SQL file (`queries.sql`) and execute the queries one by one.
4. Modify or extend queries to explore additional insights.

### Key Insights:
- Analyzed **total revenue** and **order distribution** by various factors like time, pizza type, and category.
- Generated insights into **most popular pizzas** and **pricing trends**.
- Evaluated **discount impact** and analyzed **cumulative sales** over time.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in generating insights from transactional data. By answering key business questions, I was able to uncover sales trends, customer preferences, and the most profitable pizza categories. The skills gained in SQL querying and data analysis are directly applicable to real-world business decision-making.

### Future Enhancements:
- Integrate customer demographics for personalized pizza recommendations.
- Implement machine learning to predict future sales trends.
- Expand the dataset to include reviews and ratings for more advanced analysis.
